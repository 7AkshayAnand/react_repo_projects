in router we have covered follwing things: 
a)based on our requirement we can open the pages and with new url 
b)if we want to share some part like in our case we want to share sidebar and header in both Postlist and createlist so we can do it using Layout routes
c)using link tag with "to" attribute instead of anchor tag we can ensure that  when anyone visit to our link then entire page will not be loaded
d)use useNavigate() we can navigate dynamically
